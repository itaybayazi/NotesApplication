Hello!
My name is Itay Bayazi.

This project was written in  ðŸ“² Android (Java).

In the project I used the MVVM architecture.

I did all the database and verification with Firebase.

(In the code you will see the whole application in the "ModelFirebase" class)

At first I did a nice intro to the user.

then there is a registration page and a login page (in the password you have the option by clicking on the "eye" to hide the code).

If you have already logged in once and haven't logged out, you will remain logged in the next time you open the application (active user).


You will then reach the Welcome page which is the first page opened after the intro.

This page has a menu on the right with the following options:


Logout

Add Note

(Clicking the NOTES button and jumping to the notes page will reduce the menu to the Add Note option only).

On the page you will see a Welcome message + your username.

In the center of the page, you can click on the map or the list.

By clicking on the MAP you can enter a specific note according to the location that the note writer wrote.

You can also add a note by selecting a location on the map (after clicking on a specific location you will continue to the note adding page).

Clicking on the list will open the home page of the notes.

Home (Recycle View) contains a list of notes.

Each comment when clicked has the following options:

Save button

Delete button

Upload image button

Open camera button

Delete image button

(I did the bonus section and for each note you can add a photo from the gallery or take a photo from the camera.

Of course you can add a new note anytime and anywhere.

The project was challenging and interesting and the MVVM architecture helped me keep my code clean, tidy and logical.

Hope you enjoy and be impressed by the project.
